## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fun-facts-app.git
   cd fun-facts-app
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in a browser**
3. **To edit facts**, modify the `facts` array inside `script.js`

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your repository.
3. Under **Branch**, select `main` and save.
4. Your app will be live at **https://yourusername.github.io/fun-facts-app/**

## Customization
- Modify the `facts` array in `script.js` to add your own facts.
- Customize styles in `style.css` to change the design.
- Experiment with JavaScript to add animations or new features.

## Example Code
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the JavaScript used:
```js
const facts = [
    "Cats can jump up to six times their height.",
    "The Eiffel Tower can grow up to 15 cm taller in the summer.",
    "Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not.",
    "Honey never spoils; archaeologists have found 3000-year-old honey that's still edible.",
    "There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth."
];

function generateFact() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * facts.length);
    document.getElementById("fact").textContent = facts[randomIndex];
}
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Fun facts not displaying?**
  - Ensure JavaScript is correctly linked in `index.html`.
  - Check that each fact is enclosed in quotes and separated by commas.
- **GitHub Pages not working?**
  - Confirm the source branch is set to `main` in GitHub Pages settings.
  - Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory.
